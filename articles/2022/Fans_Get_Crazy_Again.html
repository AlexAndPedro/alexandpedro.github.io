					<p>PANGILAN CITY, PANGILAN — In a massive Pangilan metro, you could say another world-destroying event is happening every day.</p>
					<p>“Pangilan City is safe once again,” said Pawesome.</p>
					<p>The longtime superdog saved the city again from some catastrophe. He gave a speech in front of Pangilan City Hall about how he loves the city or something. His fans, as always, were in front of the podium.</p>
					<p>“Pawesome! I love you! Give me your fur!”</p>
					<p>During the speech, fans of Pawesome collapsed on the ground. The medical team expected this and brought out the stretchers
					that were bought with funds from the Pawesome Collateral Damage Tax which increased income tax by 60%.</p>
					<p>“It appears that some of the hyperventilating fans were saved thanks to the limited edition Pawesome Air Bag that deployed after the device felt a sudden drop in height.”</p>
					<p>About 120 fans collapsed. After the speech, the remaining two people who got lost finding the supermarket were forced to clap as Pawesome’s fans loom over them. When Pawesome noticed this incident, he has to discipline his fans.</p>
					<p>“Hey, you bad bad fans. That’s not how you treat other people.”</p>
					<p>The fans prostrated themselves and cried for forgiveness.</p>
					<p>“Almighty Pawesome-sama. We seek your forgiveness. Also, is this the time of the year when dogs shed their fur?”</p>
					<p>Pawesome left the stage as soon as he heard another incident from far away.</p>
