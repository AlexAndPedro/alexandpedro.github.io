					<p>WOLOT, PANGILAN — Running around in circles, increasingly unhinged wolf Woronton Wilnor made a scene in Wolot Animal Hospital on Wednesday morning after his suggested names for his newborn pup were used by other wolves.</p>
					<p>“Wardor is taken. Winston is taken. Wolpin is taken. I don’t know what other names are available.” He claimed that the websites that can give him wolf name suggestions were not helpful.</p>
					<p>“Who even names their pups Wankadon? That sounds weird.”</p>
					<p>A few minutes later, a wolf bystander approached Woronton and suggested a name that does not start with the letter W. That wolf became lupus non gratus in Woronton’s territory.</p>
