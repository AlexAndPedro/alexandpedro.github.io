					<h1>How to Make Sure Your Dog is Not Wolf</h1>


					<div class="ArticleAuthor">

					<br>
					<p> Last year alone, there were 234 cases of humans mistakenly bringing home a wolf instead of their pet dog.
						“John”, whose real name Mark Antonio from 504 Apple Street, said that he was just walking around his neighborhood 
						with his creatively named pet dog “Doggy”. “Then when it’s time to go home to watch TV,
						I just have a gray wolf sitting on my lap!” “John” asked us to have him an alias to protect his identity.
						Wolf expert, Wolfy Wooferson, gave us tips and tests to figure out if your dog is actually a dog.</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Does the “dog” have a collar? If so, 99 percent, it’s a dog. The remaining 1%, it’s a wolf with a certain specific desire.</li>
						<li>Does the “dog” in question match with the dog on your pictures? If so, it’s a dog.</li>
						<li>Say sit and see if the alleged dog sits. If it does, it’s a dog. If it does not, it can still be a dog but you didn’t train it… or it’s another person’s dog in which you are a dog kidnapper. Please turn yourself in this instant.</li>
						<li>Say that Pangil the Wolf sucks. If your body is bleeding from wolf bites, then unfortunately, it’s a wolf.</li>
						<li>Is it chihuahua-sized? If yes, it’s a rat.</li>
						<li>Did you feed it some food? If so, it will eventually be a dog.</li>
						<li>Were you walking downtown? If so, it’s a furry.</li>
						<li>Does the dog have foam on its mouth? If so, RUN!</li>
						<li>Does the dog talk to you when you’re alone? If so, you need help.</li>

						<p>
							Be careful!
