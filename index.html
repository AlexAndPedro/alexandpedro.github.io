					<h1>Alex Paws vs Chocolate</h1>
					<div class = "ArticleAuthor">&#8618; posted by Bryan E.</div>
					Chocolate? Did you just say chocolate? Fine. Since you like chocolate, here is a Wikipedia article about chocolate.
					<p>
					Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground.
					It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods.
					</p>
					<p>After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugars. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.</p>

					<p>Dogs cannot eat chocolates though. Poor Alex.</p>

					<h1>Alex and Pedro on MetroPets!</h1>
					<div class = "ArticleAuthor">&#8618; posted by Bryan E.</div>
					What? An article about Alex and Pedro in a magazine website! What???????? <a href="http://www.metro-pets.com/metropets-discoveries/the-adventures-of-alex-and-pedro">Click here for the full article.</a>
					<br>
					Here is an excerpt from the article.
					<p>
					<i>
					Do you know Alex and Pedro? They are a unit – dog and master – searching for answers to life's mundane questions like
					when will the Skyway Stage 3 be finished or why is Oreo good with milk?
					Alex and Pedro have taken up residency in Facebook and YouTube as cartoon characters created by Bryan Russel S. Esperanza,
					a 17-year-old Filipino in 11th grade in California, USA. A smart kid who has won in several Sudoku tilts abroad,
					Bryan started drawing Alex and Pedro two years ago just for fun. Gradually, Alex and Pedro became more developed
					characters that are steadily attracting followers.
