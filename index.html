			<!--Hey you! Did you type F12 or Ctrl + Shift + I and try to "Inspect Element?"
			Well, good for you! Are you a hacker? Nah. I'm not hiding anything here.
			Also, there are no "secret" links or something whatsoever. If there is, then I
			wouldn't talk about it right? So carry on. No hidden links.

			By the way, did you know that Alex is a dog? Of course, I mean Alex Paws and 
			not Alex Trebek. Unless Alex Trebek is actually a dog? Nah... or maybe he is
			a furry!!! AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
					
			Fine... Since you are here anyway, I wanna give you a prize for at least trying.
			I have a very secret drawing... attach this to my website: "/images/not_safe/image_1.png"
			It's just Alex Paws.
