					<h1>Alex Paws vs Chocolate</h1>
					<div class = "ArticleAuthor">&#8618; posted by Pedro</div>
					<br>
					Chocolate? Did you just say chocolate? Fine. Since you like chocolate, here is a Wikipedia article about chocolate.
					<br><br>
					Chocolate is a typically sweet, usually brown food preparation of Theobroma cacao seeds, roasted and ground.
					It is made in the form of a liquid, paste, or in a block, or used as a flavoring ingredient in other foods.
					<br><br>
					 After fermentation, the beans are dried, cleaned, and roasted. The shell is removed to produce cacao nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form. Once the cocoa mass is liquefied by heating, it is called chocolate liquor. The liquor also may be cooled and processed into its two components: cocoa solids and cocoa butter. Baking chocolate, also called bitter chocolate, contains cocoa solids and cocoa butter in varying proportions, without any added sugars. Much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar. Milk chocolate is sweet chocolate that additionally contains milk powder or condensed milk. White chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.
